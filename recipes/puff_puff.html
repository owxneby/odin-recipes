        <p>Puff-puff is a popular Nigerian snack made from deep-fried dough. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make puff-puff</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of nutmeg (optional)</li>

          </ul>

        <h3>Step by Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water. Add a pinch of sugar and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active.
          </li>

          <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift the all-purpose flour. Add sugar, nutmeg (if using), and a pinch of salt. Mix well to combine.            
          </li>

          <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the activated yeast mixture. Gradually incorporate the flour into the liquid, stirring continuously until you have a smooth, thick batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.            
          </li>

          <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the batter rest in a warm place for about 1-2 hours. During this time, the batter will ferment and rise, becoming light and fluffy.            
          </li>

          <li>In a deep saucepan or fryer, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until it reaches about 350°F (175°C). Use enough oil to fully submerge the puff-puff balls while frying.            
          </li>

          <li>Once the batter has risen and is airy, give it a gentle stir. Use a spoon or your hand to scoop up some batter and drop it into the hot oil. You can form small balls by scooping the batter with your fingers and using your thumb to slide it into the oil, or you can use two spoons to shape the batter into balls before dropping them into the oil.            
          </li>

          <li>Fry the puff-puff in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each batch for about 3-4 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and puffed up. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the oil temperature.           
          </li>

          <li>Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the puff-puff from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil.            
          </li>

          <li>Serve the puff-puff warm as a snack or dessert. They are best enjoyed fresh, but you can also store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day.            
          </li>
          
        </ul>
        <p><b>You can dust the puff-puff with powdered sugar or serve them with a dipping sauce of your choice for added flavor.</b></p>
